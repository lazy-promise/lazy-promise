# Lazy Promise

A Promise-like primitive which is lazy/cancelable, has typed errors, and emits synchronously instead of on the microtask queue.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @lazy-promise/core pipe-function
```

In the above snippet, `pipe-function` [package](https://github.com/ivan7237d/pipe-function) provides the `pipe` function, but there is nothing special about it and you can use the same function from another library. `pipe(x, foo, bar)` is `bar(foo(x))`.

## Usage

Coming soon.
